923     0       2014-12-08      The food at snack is a selection of popular Greek dishes. The appetizer tray is good as is the Greek salad. We were underwhelmed with the main courses. There are 4-5 tables here so it's sometimes hard to get seated. 
924     0       2013-05-16      This little place in Soho is wonderful. I had a lamb sandwich and a glass of wine. The price shocked me for how small the serving was, but then again, this is Soho. The staff can be a little snotty and rude, but the food is great, just don't expect world-class service. 
925     0       2013-07-01      ordered lunch for 15 from Snack last Friday.  On time, nothing missing and the food was great.  I have added it to the regular company lunch list, as everyone enjoyed their meal. 
926     0       2011-07-28      This is a beautiful quaint little restaurant on a pretty street.  If you're strolling through soho around lunchtime, this would be a great place to stop for a bite. I heard the reviews about the lamb sandwich, so I had to try it. I'm very happy that i did. Every single ingredient - from the bread to the onions and tomatoes, the lamb and the sauce - was delicious. These four stars are well deserved because of the tasty sandwich and great ambiance.  I would recommend this place to anyone. 
927     0       2010-11-01      Snack is great place for a  casual sit down lunch- especially on a cold winter day.  In many ways the restaurant mirrors the food- simple yet unique.  The avgolemono soup was lemony perfection and the butter bean salad hearty yet light.  The greek coffee is different...they sweeten it with honey which makes for an interesting thickness and sweet spice. I definitely plan on going back for dinner.  If the small space doesn't suit you their sister restaurant Snack Taverna in the West Village is just as good, if not better...and more "upscale" with waiters who make you feel well taken care of. 
928     0       2009-09-02      A solid 4 stars for this greek food spot.  If you're a fan of lamb like I am, you must come here and try the lamb sandwich.  Amazingly tender and juicy with onions and arugula.  Also had a good greek salad. 
929     0       2009-08-25      Let me start with a shout-out to everyone who is boosting the mint lemonade. That stuff is super tasty.  I refuse to believe you can get fresher, more delicious Greek food for your dollar.   I sport the lunch here regularly: huge sandwiches filled with marinated vegetables or succulent meats (the lamb is particularly choice) on a floury ciabatta with an ideal crust-crunch to soft-inner-womb.   The cold meze options are favorites.  I know that anyone can take good feta, cover it with salt, pepper, olive oil, and dish it up with some olives and tomatoes, but the quality and proportion of each of those ingredients is what makes it special here.  Heaven. You can rock a sandwich for $7.50 to $9.50 or grab bigger meals for no more than the mid-teens.  Get it done. 
930     0       2007-05-20      Love this place!  Try the Chicken sandwich or the Roasted Chicken.  Those are winners every time.  Really delicious and worth the wait. 
931     0       2005-12-27      My friend and I were intrigued by the nightly entree special, "Little Shoes," (eggplant stuffed with ground sirloin), and so we decided to eat at Snack. Although very tiny, we were able to stand while we waited and have a glass of wine at the narrow 'bar.' I absolutely loved the atmosphere, but I was a bit disappointed to find out that they were out of the entree special by the time we sat down. My substitute entree, Veg. Moussaka, was hearty and good, but cinnamon overpowered the other flavors. My friend had the stuffed tomato and green pepper plate, which I liked better. 
932     0       2014-05-09      Stopped in for lunch today and couldn't believe how delicious everything was! My boyfriend and I shared an avgolemono soup, lamb sandwich, spanakoptikia and baklava. Everything came out super quickly and far exceeded our expectations.  The service was wonderful too! We will definitely be back! 
933     0       2014-01-21      pretty cool place...good food...good people 
934     0       2014-01-20      all around good place, cozy, I came in and didn't have a huge appetite but just stuck to the appetizers...which my friend and I did the combo platter of and we were more than full with it. 
935     0       2011-01-31      Fabulous Authentic Greek Food!!! This little spot is bold with great flavors. Knowledgable host that describes the layers of a food like you were sitting in the kitchen watching the preparation. If you are a true foodie you don't want to miss Snack!
936     0       2008-07-07      Perfection.  Snack has become my favorite late lunch/early dinner spot.  Make sure to try the butter beans!!! 
937     0       2014-10-15      Tiny little place, but very good food. Pastitsio was especially good. 
938     0       2014-10-10      I had the braised lamb sandwich and was one of the best sandwiches of my life. Do yourself a favour and try this place! Friendly service and cosy atmosphere. 
939     0       2014-10-03      This spot is close to my job so I decided to check it out for lunch. The prices are just about what you would expect for Soho/"South Village" sit-down lunch prices; my meal came out to $20 for a mint lemonade and a decent-sized salad. I ordered what I think may have been a special, a roasted chicken & vegetable salad. The chicken was unbelievably dry, to the point where I had tough time chewing without choking a bit. It was served on a bed of arugula which could have chopped a little finer as it was in full, hard to eat pieces. When I eat a salad, I expect it to be cut down to make for easier bites. Not necessarily a chopped salad, just pieces that will actually fit in your mouth without chopping it up yourself. Basically, I don't want to use a knife to eat a salad. However, service was friendly & quick and the restaurant itself was comfortable, albeit tiny. I would go back to try something else, but probably not for a salad. 
940     0       2014-09-16      For lunch, my friend and I had: -Lamb sandwich, juicy and flavorful. -Roasted beet salad, pretty big portion. Good thing my friend shared it with me; otherwise I think I would so bored eating only beets, and a few leaves of greens. -Classic Greek Avolemono, basically a very tangy chicken broth with orzo. My friend really likes it at this place. The place is small. There are only 6 tables, but they do delivery. Good service if you decide to dine in. 
941     0       2014-08-10      Needed a quick, healthy light "lunch" and this place was perfect! Next time I'll definitely have yo plan better so I can try some of their hardier sandwiches and dishes. ALL the food looked AMAZING and the items we had were DELICIOUS! 
942     0       2014-06-17      Their artichoke chicken salad is good and plenty. 
943     0       2014-05-24      Some good Big Greek cooking!! Came to City on a gorgeous Sunday after a brutal winter one of the first clear sunny crisp Sundays to walk about Soho one of my fav's to do... And we were hungry and decided to try this hole in a wall gem!  Literally a hole in the wall which I think is perfect I believe they have 5 tables and it's so small the restroom is down the hall! The food is delicious...had the hummus, warm pita, lamb stew was fresh & just perfect, pastitsio (sp?) was perfect and portion were just enough! They dimmed the lights lit candles and it was a perfect way to end a Sunday...full tummy, wine, a real gem! The service is good hard not to be in such a small place! You feel like your in someone's home with other guest - the cooking is down home good! 
944     0       2014-05-21      Needed a quick bite and stopped here because of the reviews.  It's really cute and small inside. Had the roasted sandwich and it was good.  Service was very friendly, too.  Nice place to break from shopping 
945     0       2014-04-10      Food was delicious and service was great. Good atmosphere for a quick bite alone or to catch up with friends. 
946     0       2014-03-29      Awesome hole in the wall place to grab a quick bite. Great music, great vibes and great service. The lentil soup and steak sandwich was absolutely to die for. The space is really small yet cozy. 
947     0       2014-03-21      I love this place! Great soups and Greek salad and spinach pie and tuna sandwiches. I've been a fan for years. The dining "room" is small and cramped but prices are low and the food is always fresh and delicious. I've only been there for lunch and look forward to going back for dinner. Services is fine -- not special - but more than adequate for a special little SOHO secret gem 
948     0       2014-03-08      The food is amazing! The service is equally amazing! My friends and I are definitely coming back to this place. 
949     0       2014-03-01      Quick, delicious and filling. After a few hours of shopping in SoHo we were starving. They couldn't accommodate the three of us at first (it's tiny), but took my number and called us back like 15 mins later. Fresh ingredients and the flavors hit all the right notes. The pastitsio was delicate, the hummus was creamy and the dolmades werent too dense, or tart. Service was with a smile, too. Definitely good to try on a mellow Saturday afternoon. 
950     0       2014-01-24      Delicious, consistent, well-priced. Food tastes clean and feels like its made with love. 
951     0       2014-01-18      Really quaint little "hole in the wall" kind of stop. Only a block away from the avenue of the Americas in Soho. There's only 4 tables for about 8 people at anytime but it didn't seem too much of a problem at 1:30pm on a Saturday. Really freshly authentic Greek food and pure cane sugar soft drinks were definitely something different. Definitely worth 5 stars. Relatively cheap as well. 
952     0       2014-01-16      Delicious lamb sandwich 
953     0       2013-10-17      So... as you may notice from some of my other reviews... i am not the healthiest eater (.. I DO try).  Snack has about the BEST Greek Salad I have ever tasted.  Big juicy tomatoes... crunchy fresh cucumbers...fantastic olive oil dressing.  I don't eat greek salads typcially - but I do eat them at Snack...Actually, I crave them when visting New York.  You should try it! 
954     0       2013-10-02      Novelty meets Mediterranean meets SoHo. This place can only squeeze in about 8-10 at 2 seater tables; and I do mean squeeze! But its a money spot for lunch or a quick on the go bite. Go for their lamb sandwich, the dressings are fantastic flavor pairings. If you're looking for something lighter for both your stomach and your wallet, try the soup. The Mediterranean sandwich is full of veggies too. Great variety, cute location, good food. 
955     0       2013-09-10      Been meaning to try this place for a while-highly recommended by a friend. Had the tuna sandwich...good but got TERRIBLY SICK after word. Also, sage tea was nice. 
956     0       2013-08-22      If you're looking for authentic Greek and a cozy atmosphere, this is the place. Seriously, it's cozy. There are maybe 5-6 tables in this place. However, despite it's tininess, the server was very helpful to each and every customer in the restaurant. My girlfriend and I had to wait a few minutes to be seated but he took the time to explain some of the Greek drinks and menu items to us. The service was fantastic and and the food was prepared very quickly, and though I'm new to the city, I'm certain it will stay on my list for a very long time as being the best Greek I have ever had. We ordered the Tzatziki cucumber yogurt, Houmus, and Tiropitakia cheese triangles. I strongly recommend this place!
957     0       2013-08-02      Great find in SoHo.  We could have been satisfied with the huge Greek salad and side of hummus, but also got a chicken souvlaki sandwich special that was killer.  It's a small place but really charming and worth checking out. 
958     0       2013-06-23      The taramosalata is to die for.  I recommend the Shrimp Santorini. Also, my good friend who is Greek loves this restaurant and says it tastes very authentic! 
959     0       2013-04-30      What a pleasant little shop. Tiny, cute, liquor license, credit cards accepted, intimate....perfection ensues We went for a light dinner and ordered the roasted red pepper salad and the lamb koftikas. The salad had tons of red peppers, a bit potent, but very good. But the Lamb Koftikas, omg, have you ever wondered what you're doing wrong? What's that missing secret ingredient? Well look no further, it's pine nuts. How did I not know this, add it to meatballs and you're in for a treat. The wait staff was extremely pleasant and made wandering randomly into Snack a great experience. I will have to come back when I can eat more than half of an entree. 
960     0       2013-04-16      This place is TINY! I think it fits 10 people max. Keep that in mind when considering to come here on a weekend night. The food was great though and setting romantic! I recommend coming here if you're in the area and there is an open seat. Oh word of warning, but i guess it's standard for smaller shop establishments in NYC, i saw a roach on the wall here. 
961     0       2013-04-10      Lamb sandwich... mmm... eat here. 
962     0       2013-03-25      I ordered the spinach pies. Not very good. Soggy. No real taste. Also got the artichoke chicken salad. Portion size was huge but chicken was dry     . 
963     0       2013-03-02      This tiny cafe on Thompson has been a favorite of mine for years, and I'll tell you why. Everything is fresh and the attention to detail makes it a keeper. The lamb sammie on ciabatta is melt in your mouth chunks of lamb, with roasted onions and pretty much to die for. It's big enough for two gals to share, for sure. My favorite soup of all time, they rock here -- the Avgolemono is super lemony and perfect, with al dente orzo. Served with toasted slivers of olive oil coated fresh bread. And in every take away bag then toss little twists of waxed paper filled with a few Jordan almonds. Pretty adorable, since I'm a sucker for these little touches. 
964     0       2013-02-20      I was impressed! This was my first time picking up food from Snack. I had no idea it was a Greek place after walking by a few times. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality at this tiny but quaint eatery. I'm half Greek so I've had a lot of Avgolemeno soup - I got the Snack version and was totally blown away! I loved the big orzo rice and the flavor was perfectly lemony and super delicious. The Chicken Artichoke salad was WOW! Its huge and there was a generous amount of roasted chicken and all of the other fresh and tasty toppings. My minor suggestion for the kitchen would be to cook the potatoes just a little more. But that didn't affect the overall amazingness of this salad. This will definitely be a place I will be visiting again! 
965     0       2013-02-14      Ohhh Snack. I love you, Snack. I order from here often since it's close to my work and their delivery is always precise and on-time. Their avgolemono and vegetarian souvlaki are fantastic and I hope that one day, maybe, I'll be able to replicate their giant beans in that delicious dill tomato sauce. I haven't yet eaten in the store itself, but I'm sure it'll be just as enjoyable as digging into my brown paper sack for the best (and still reasonably priced) lunch I can find in SoHo. 
966     0       2012-12-19      I don't understand the whole "You can't order off the lunch menu if you're sitting down for dinner" thing, especially when your restaurant is empty.  You'd think they'd be glad for the chance to earn a tip and the glass of wine or 2 I might order... but I guess not.  -1 star for that... The lamb sandwich to go though was pretty awesome.  I'd go back and try a sit down dinner, but I guess I wouldn't be able to have that sandwich again.
967     0       2012-12-15      Perfect for what the name implies: great butter bean salad and even better winter soups. Perfect for dates or other one-on-one dinner. I wouldn't bring a part of more than four here - it's exclusively single tables and seats maybe 14 all together. Really a gem, especially because it doesn't advertise itself as a Greek restaurant, but the food is definitely Mediterranean. 
968     0       2012-11-16      Really delicious sandwich- had the lamb. It was enormous and I was able to eat it in two meals. Tight though, so I'd recommend grabbing and going. Definitely a neat block to visit for lunch if you ever get bored of Sullivan st. Plus they accept credit cards! 
969     0       2012-10-25      I went to this place once before and LOVED it. I bragged about it to a friend and took her to eat there last week. Well, it wasn't good a second time around and that is a shame. We ordered the tuna salad, skordalia (garlic dip) and chicken souvlaki sandwich. The tuna salad was fine - I really can't complain about that. The skordalia was not fine and was more like soup than a dip. So watery and not authentic at all. The chicken souvlaki sandwich was ice cold. Like it was in a freezer. Also to add to the disappointment was the super weird waitress. Maybe she was overwhelmed or something..I don't know.  Anyway, can't say I'd go back and that's a bummer because I really liked it the first time. 
970     0       2012-10-07      Delicious, savory, creamy--try the pastitsio, vegetarian mousaka, stuffed grape leaves, baklava. Lunch-wise, I wouldn't recommend the artichoke/chicken salad--the big chunks of chicken resembled the big chunks of potato. Lovely atmosphere--just a few tables lined up along a mirrored wall, across from imported canned goods. Intimate at night, and bright and charming at lunch. 
971     0       2012-09-16      Super small but it felt cozy rather than cramped. Get the lamb sandwich!!!
972     0       2012-08-12      Lacklustre service, soggy lukewarm spinach pie and two-day-old cucumber salad. Go to Local instead! 
973     0       2012-08-03      I am Greek, and a huge fan of Greek food, so a bit of a tough critic, but Snack is very good. Not fantastic, but pretty good. The tzatziki and hummus is awesome, but make sure to get extra pita!
